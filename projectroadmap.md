# Soil Health Check App - Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
The **Soil Health Check App** is designed to assist farmers, environmental scientists, and agronomists in assessing soil health. The app will utilize a decision-tree-based system to evaluate indicators like soil compaction, residue breakdown, and soil structure. By digitizing these assessments, users will receive actionable insights on soil health, promoting sustainable agricultural practices.

This roadmap outlines key milestones, code exploration insights, and planned development stages.

## Project Milestones

### Sprint 1: Initial Setup and Code Exploration
1
### Sprint 1: Decision Tree Development
1.**Implement Basic Decision Tree**: Develop and test decision-tree logic based on soil health indicators.
2. **Data Input and Storage**: Create forms or input fields for users to enter soil health data and enable basic data storage.
3. **Initial UI Design**: Begin developing a user-friendly interface for mobile and desktop use.
##Completed Decision tree program 11/16/2024 . having issues with UI. need to contact professor for assistance
### Sprint 2: Advanced Features
1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Explore incorporating a machine learning model for deeper analysis, using insights from code exploration- will use for future data collection updates past the project.
2. **Data Logging and Comparison**: Implement a feature to log user data and enable comparisons over time. Decided not to colelct data at this time for project simplification
3. **Report Generation**: Design a report generation feature that summarizes soil health assessments.
   ## 11/17/2024Completed modifications for Report Generation. Still need to work on UI design! 

### Future Development
1. **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure the app is fully optimized for mobile use.
2. **User Feedback and Testing**: Gather user feedback and refine the app's functionality and design.

## My Code Exploration Summary

### Explored Codebase: Spam/Non-Spam Classification
**GitHub Link**: [Spam/Non-spam Classification](https://github.com/hitesh-anand/Spam_Non-spam_classification/blob/master/200449_python.ipynb)

### Key Insights from Code Exploration

1. **Decision-Making Models**:
   - This code implements classification logic to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages. Adapting similar classification logic or decision tree models will allow the app to analyze soil health indicators and recommend actions based on specific conditions, such as compaction or organic matter levels.
