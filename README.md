# Soil-Health-Checker
The Soil Health Check App will be designed to assist farmers, environmental scientists, and agronomists in evaluating soil health using digital tools that streamline assessment.


## Project Description
The **Soil Health Check App** is designed to support farmers, environmental scientists, and agronomists in assessing soil health using an accessible digital tool. Inspired by the needs expressed by Dr. Lashunda Anderson Hodges, a Doctor of Agronomy at Southern University, this app will streamline soil health assessment for the Farmer Extension program. 

The app will use a decision-tree system to evaluate various soil health indicators, such as soil compaction, residue breakdown, soil structure, and plant root health. This tool will provide real-time feedback on soil health status, helping users make informed decisions about crop management and soil conservation. Leveraging Python and possibly machine learning for more advanced insights, the Soil Health Check App aims to improve agricultural efficiency and sustainability.

## Key Features
- **Decision Tree-Based Soil Assessment**: Users enter specific soil conditions, and the app guides them through an assessment, providing insights based on the input.
- **Data Logging and Comparison**: The app allows users to record observations over time, building a longitudinal view of soil health.

  
## Potential Users
- **Farmers and Agronomists**: To track soil conditions and improve crop productivity.
- **Environmental Scientists**: To monitor soil health across different ecosystems.


## Project Roadmap
- **Sprint 1**: Complete initial project setup, including repository creation, setup of `README.md`, and exploration of similar projects for relevant code and features.
- **Future Sprints**: Implement decision-tree logic, add data logging capabilities, and integrate reporting features.
